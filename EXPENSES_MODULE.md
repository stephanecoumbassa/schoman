## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Create Expense:**
   ```bash
   # Login first to get token
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"admin@schoman.com","password":"admin123"}'
   
   # Create expense
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/expenses \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "category": "supplies",
       "description": "Test expense",
       "amount": 10000,
       "payee": "Test Vendor",
       "paymentMethod": "cash",
       "academicYear": "2024-2025"
     }'
   ```

2. **Get Expenses:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/expenses \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

   ```

## Integration with Other Modules

### Current Integration
- **Authentication Module** - Uses JWT authentication
- **User Management** - References users for recordedBy and approvedBy
- **Dashboard** - Quick access link

### Future Integration Opportunities
- **Accounting Module** - Integrate with general ledger
- **Budgeting Module** - Compare expenses against budgets
- **Reporting Module** - Generate financial reports
- **Billing Module** - Compare income vs expenses

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexes:**
   - Text search index on description and payee
   - Category and date indexes for fast filtering
   
2. **Pagination:**
   - All list endpoints support pagination
   - Maximum 100 items per page

3. **Query Optimization:**
   - Selective field population
   - Aggregation pipelines for statistics
   - Efficient date range queries

## Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication:**
   - JWT tokens required for all endpoints
   - Token stored in localStorage
   - Automatic logout on token expiration

2. **Authorization:**
   - Server-side role checks
   - UI elements hidden based on role
   - Middleware protection on routes

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Required field validation
   - Amount must be positive
   - Valid category and payment method enums
   - MongoDB schema validation

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Expense categories management (add/edit categories)
- [ ] Recurring expenses (monthly salaries)
- [ ] Budget allocation and tracking
- [ ] Expense approval workflow
- [ ] File attachments for receipts

### Medium Term
- [ ] Export to PDF/Excel
- [ ] Email notifications for large expenses
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Expense reports by period
- [ ] Budget vs actual analysis

### Long Term
- [ ] Integration with accounting software
- [ ] Automated expense categorization (AI)
- [ ] Mobile expense submission
- [ ] OCR for receipt scanning
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Expenses not loading
- Check authentication token is valid
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Cannot create expense
- Verify user has admin or teacher role
- Check all required fields are filled
- Ensure amount is positive number

### Issue: Statistics not showing
- Check if expenses exist in database
- Verify academic year filter
- Check MongoDB aggregation pipeline

### Issue: Search not working
- Ensure text indexes are created
- Verify search query is not empty
- Check MongoDB connection
