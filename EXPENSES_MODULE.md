}
```

Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "totalExpenses": 15,
  "totalAmount": 2450000,
  "byCategory": [
    {
      "_id": "salaries",
      "count": 5,
      "totalAmount": 1800000
    },
    {
      "_id": "supplies",
      "count": 6,
      "totalAmount": 350000
    }
  ],
  "period": {
    "startDate": "2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z",

  }
}
```

}
```

### Delete Expense

```bash
DELETE /api/expenses/60d5ec49f1b2c72b8c8e4567
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization

- All routes require authentication (JWT token)
- Expense creation/editing: Admin and Teacher roles
- Expense deletion: Admin role only
- Viewing: All authenticated users

### Data Validation

- Description required, trimmed
- Category must be valid enum value
- Amount must be >= 0
- Date must be valid date
- Payment method must be valid enum value
- RecordedBy automatically set from authenticated user

### Soft Delete

- Deleted expenses are marked inactive (isActive: false)
- Data preserved for audit trail
- Can be restored if needed (manual database operation)

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

Three indexes for optimal query performance:
1. `{ category: 1, date: -1 }` - Category filtering with date sorting
2. `{ date: -1 }` - Date-based sorting
3. `{ recordedBy: 1, date: -1 }` - User-specific expense tracking

### Pagination

- Default page size: 10 expenses
- Maximum page size: 100 expenses
- Reduces data transfer and improves response time

### Aggregation

Statistics use MongoDB aggregation pipeline for efficient calculation of:
- Group counts by category
- Total amounts per category
- Overall totals

## Expense Categories Explained

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Salaries** | Employee wages and benefits | Monthly salaries, bonuses, allowances |
| **Supplies** | School materials and equipment | Notebooks, pens, paper, chalk, markers |
| **Maintenance** | Repairs and upkeep | Building repairs, equipment servicing, cleaning |
| **Utilities** | Public services | Electricity, water, internet, phone |
| **Transport** | Transportation costs | Fuel, vehicle maintenance, field trips |
| **Other** | Miscellaneous expenses | Insurance, subscriptions, miscellaneous fees |

## Payment Methods

| Method | Description | Use Cases |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cash** (Esp√®ces) | Physical currency | Small purchases, petty cash |
| **Check** (Ch√®que) | Bank check | Vendor payments, salaries |
| **Bank Transfer** (Virement) | Electronic transfer | Regular bills, large payments |
| **Credit Card** (Carte) | Card payment | Online purchases, subscriptions |
| **Mobile Money** | Mobile payment | Quick payments, modern vendors |

## Integration Points

### With Existing Modules

- **Authentication**: Uses JWT and role-based access
- **Users**: References user records for recordedBy field
- **Dashboard**: Can display expense statistics

### Future Integration Opportunities

- **Accounting Module**: Automated journal entries for expenses
- **Invoicing Module**: Link expenses to cost analysis
- **Reports Module**: Financial reports combining income and expenses
- **Budget Module**: Budget vs. actual expense tracking
- **Approval Workflow**: Multi-level approval for large expenses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Expense not creating**
- Verify description is provided
- Check amount is a positive number
- Ensure date is a valid date
- Verify category and paymentMethod are valid
