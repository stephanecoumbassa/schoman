## API Endpoints (15 total)

### Invoices (8 endpoints)
```
GET    /api/invoices                    - List with filters
GET    /api/invoices/statistics         - Financial statistics
GET    /api/invoices/student/:studentId - Student's invoices
GET    /api/invoices/:id                - Single invoice details
POST   /api/invoices                    - Create new invoice
POST   /api/invoices/update-overdue     - Mark overdue invoices
PUT    /api/invoices/:id                - Update invoice
DELETE /api/invoices/:id                - Delete invoice
```

### Payments (7 endpoints)
```
GET    /api/payments                    - List with filters
GET    /api/payments/statistics         - Payment statistics
GET    /api/payments/student/:studentId - Student's payments
GET    /api/payments/:id                - Single payment details
POST   /api/payments                    - Record new payment
PUT    /api/payments/:id                - Update payment
DELETE /api/payments/:id                - Delete payment
```

## Business Logic

### Invoice Status Flow
```
draft ‚Üí issued ‚Üí partial ‚Üí paid
          ‚Üì
       overdue (if past due date)
          ‚Üì
      cancelled (manual)
```

### Automatic Calculations
- **Subtotal**: Sum of all line items (quantity √ó unit price)
- **Total**: Subtotal - discount + tax
- **Balance**: Total - amount paid
- **Status**: Auto-updates based on payment state

### Data Integrity
- Payment amount cannot exceed invoice balance
- Invoices with payments cannot be deleted
- Deleting payment reverses invoice update
- Automatic validation of student and invoice references

## Sample Data

Created by seed script:

**3 Invoices:**
1. Fully paid (160,000 FCFA) - Status: paid
2. Partially paid (170,000 FCFA, paid 100,000) - Status: partial
3. Unpaid (150,000 FCFA) - Status: issued

**2 Payments:**
1. Full payment via bank transfer (160,000 FCFA)
2. Partial payment in cash (100,000 FCFA)

## Technical Quality
