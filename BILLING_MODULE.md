## Security & Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control

| Feature | View Access | Create/Edit | Delete |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Invoices | All authenticated users | Admin & Teachers | Admin only |
| Payments | All authenticated users | Admin & Teachers | Admin only |

### Security Features
- ✅ JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Authorization middleware checks user roles
- ✅ UI elements conditionally rendered based on role
- ✅ Server-side validation of all inputs
- ✅ Protection against unauthorized modifications

## Business Logic

### Invoice Status Flow

```
draft → issued → partial → paid
          ↓
       overdue (if past due date)
          ↓
      cancelled (manual)
```

**Status Transitions:**
1. **draft** - Initial state, can be edited freely
2. **issued** - Sent to student, no payments yet
3. **partial** - Some payment received (0 < paid < total)
4. **paid** - Fully paid (paid = total)
5. **overdue** - Past due date and not fully paid
6. **cancelled** - Manually cancelled

### Automatic Calculations

**Invoice Creation:**
```javascript
subtotal = sum(item.quantity * item.unitPrice)
total = subtotal - discount + tax
balance = total - amountPaid
```

**Payment Recording:**
```javascript
invoice.amountPaid += payment.amount
invoice.balance = invoice.total - invoice.amountPaid

if (balance === 0) status = 'paid'
else if (amountPaid > 0) status = 'partial'
else status = 'issued'
```

### Data Integrity

- ✅ Payment amount cannot exceed invoice balance
- ✅ Invoices with payments cannot be deleted
- ✅ Deleting payment reverses invoice update
- ✅ Student and invoice validation before payment
- ✅ Automatic number generation prevents duplicates

## Sample Data

The seed script (`backend/src/scripts/seed.ts`) creates:

**3 Sample Invoices:**
1. **Invoice 1** - Fully paid (Status: paid)
   - Student: Pierre Martin
   - Total: 160,000 FCFA
   - Items: School fees (150,000) + Insurance (10,000)
   - Paid: 160,000 FCFA
   - Balance: 0 FCFA

2. **Invoice 2** - Partially paid (Status: partial)
   - Student: Sophie Durand
   - Total: 170,000 FCFA (after 5,000 discount)
   - Items: School fees (150,000) + Supplies (25,000)
   - Paid: 100,000 FCFA
   - Balance: 70,000 FCFA

3. **Invoice 3** - Unpaid (Status: issued)
   - Student: Third student
   - Total: 150,000 FCFA
   - Items: School fees (150,000)
   - Paid: 0 FCFA
   - Balance: 150,000 FCFA

**2 Sample Payments:**
1. Full payment for Invoice 1 (Bank transfer)
2. Partial payment for Invoice 2 (Cash)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Invoice not found" error**
- Verify the invoice ID is correct

- Ensure user has permission to view

**2. "Amount exceeds balance" error**
- Check the current invoice balance
- Verify payment amount is not more than remaining balance
- Review existing payments on the invoice

**3. "Cannot delete invoice with payments"**
- Delete all associated payments first
- Or cancel the invoice instead of deleting

**4. Numbers not auto-generating**
- Check database connectivity
- Verify models are properly configured
- Ensure pre-save hooks are working

**5. Status not updating after payment**
- Verify payment amount is correct
- Check invoice total and balance calculations
- Review payment controller logic
