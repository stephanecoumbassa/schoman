### For Students/Parents

Students can view invoices assigned to them but cannot create, edit, or delete them.

## Database Seeding

The seed script creates 3 sample invoices:

1. **INV-2024-00001** - Paid invoice
   - Student: First enrolled student
   - Items: Tuition (150,000 XAF), Materials (25,000 XAF)
   - Status: Paid
   - Payment: Bank transfer

2. **INV-2024-00002** - Sent invoice
   - Student: Second enrolled student
   - Items: Tuition (150,000 XAF)
   - Status: Sent
   - Payment: Pending

3. **INV-2024-00003** - Draft invoice
   - Student: Third enrolled student
   - Items: Tuition (150,000 XAF), Transport (30,000 XAF), Cafeteria (20,000 XAF)
   - Status: Draft
   - Payment: Not sent yet

## API Examples

### Create Invoice

```bash
POST /api/invoices
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "student": "60d5ec49f1b2c72b8c8e4567",
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Frais de scolarit√© - Trimestre 1",
      "category": "tuition",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unitPrice": 150000
    }
  ],
  "taxRate": 0,
  "dueDate": "2024-12-31",
  "notes": "Premier trimestre"
}
```

### List Invoices with Filters

```bash
GET /api/invoices?status=sent&student=60d5ec49f1b2c72b8c8e4567&page=1&limit=10
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Record Payment

```bash
POST /api/invoices/60d5ec49f1b2c72b8c8e4568/payment
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paymentDate": "2024-10-02",
  "paymentMethod": "bank_transfer",
  "paymentReference": "TRX-2024-001"
}
```

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization

- All routes require authentication (JWT token)
- Invoice creation/editing: Admin and Teacher roles
- Payment recording: Admin and Teacher roles
- Deletion: Admin role only
- Viewing: All authenticated users (filtered by access)

### Data Validation

- Invoice number uniqueness enforced
- Student existence validated
- Quantity must be >= 1
- Unit price must be >= 0
- Tax rate must be 0-100%
- Status must be valid enum value
- Cannot modify paid/cancelled invoices
- Cannot delete paid invoices

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

Three indexes for optimal query performance:
1. `{ student: 1, status: 1 }` - Student invoices by status
2. `{ invoiceNumber: 1 }` - Unique invoice lookup
3. `{ status: 1, dueDate: 1 }` - Overdue queries

### Pagination

- Default page size: 10 invoices
- Maximum page size: 100 invoices
- Reduces data transfer and improves response time

### Aggregation

Statistics use MongoDB aggregation pipeline for efficient calculation of:
- Group counts by status
- Total revenue (paid invoices only)
- Overdue invoice count

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] PDF invoice generation with logo and template
- [ ] Email invoice to parents automatically
- [ ] Recurring invoice templates
- [ ] Partial payment support
- [ ] Payment plan/installment feature
- [ ] Late fee calculation for overdue invoices
- [ ] Bulk invoice generation for classes

- [ ] Invoice preview before sending
- [ ] Email reminders for due dates
- [ ] Receipt generation for paid invoices
- [ ] Integration with accounting module
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Discount/voucher codes
- [ ] Payment gateway integration

## Integration Points
