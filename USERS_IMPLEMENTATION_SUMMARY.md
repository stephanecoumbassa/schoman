2. Update user information
3. Change user passwords
4. Search and filter users
5. Try to delete last admin (should fail)
6. Test pagination with multiple users
7. Verify role-based access control

## 📚 Integration with Existing Modules

### Seamless Integration
The Users Management Module integrates perfectly with:

1. **Authentication Module**
   - Uses existing JWT authentication
   - Leverages existing auth middleware
   - Compatible with existing login system

2. **Student Module**
   - Complements student management
   - Clear separation between students and staff
   - Students managed through separate interface

3. **Class Module**
   - Teachers can be assigned to classes
   - User module provides teacher listings
   - Maintains consistency in teacher references

4. **Grade Module**
   - Teachers reference maintained
   - User module provides teacher authentication
   - Compatible with existing grade recording

5. **Dashboard**
   - New quick action card added
   - Visible only to administrators
   - Follows existing dashboard pattern

## 🎨 UI Design Consistency

### Visual Elements
- Purple theme for user management (user group icon)
- Matches existing card design on dashboard
- Consistent table layout with other views
- Same modal design pattern
- Matching form styling
- Identical pagination controls

### Color Coding
- **Admin**: Purple badge
- **Teacher**: Blue badge
- **Parent**: Green badge
- **Active**: Green status
- **Inactive**: Red status

## 📋 API Documentation

Complete API documentation added to `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`:
- 7 endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Query parameter specifications
- Authentication requirements
- Authorization levels
- Error responses

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints require valid JWT token
- Admin-only access for management operations
- Teachers have read-only access to user list
- Passwords never returned in responses

### Data Protection
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- Email addresses stored in lowercase
- Soft delete capability with isActive flag
- Cannot delete last admin (system protection)

### Input Validation
- Email format validation
- Password length requirements (min 6 chars)
- Required field validation
- Email uniqueness checks
- Role enum validation

## 🌟 Notable Features

### 1. Last Admin Protection
Prevents system lockout by ensuring at least one admin exists:
```typescript
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  const adminCount = await User.countDocuments({ role: 'admin', isActive: true });
  if (adminCount <= 1) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Impossible de supprimer le dernier administrateur' });
  }
}
```

### 2. Debounced Search
Improves performance with delayed search execution:
```typescript
let debounceTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>;
const debouncedSearch = () => {
  clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
  debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    fetchUsers();
  }, 500);
};
```

### 3. Separate Password Endpoint
Security best practice - passwords changed via dedicated endpoint:
```typescript
PUT /api/users/:id/password
{
  "password": "newpassword123"
}
```

### 4. Role-Based Filtering
Easy filtering by user role in the interface:
- Admin
- Teacher
- Parent

### 5. Statistics Dashboard
Quick overview of user distribution:
```json
{
  "totalUsers": 50,
  "activeUsers": 48,
  "inactiveUsers": 2,
  "usersByRole": {
    "admin": 3,
    "teacher": 15,
    "parent": 30
  }
}
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Separate from Students?
- Students have additional fields (student number, level, class, etc.)
- Different workflow (enrollment vs employment)
- Different access patterns
- Clearer separation of concerns

### Why Password-Only Update Endpoint?
- Security best practice
- Prevents accidental password changes
- Allows different validation rules
- Clearer audit trail

### Why Prevent Last Admin Deletion?
- Prevents system lockout
- Ensures administrative access
- Safety mechanism
- Common best practice

### Why Admin-Only Access?
- Sensitive user information
- Security considerations
- Role-based access control
- Organizational hierarchy
