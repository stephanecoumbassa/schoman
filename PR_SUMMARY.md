## 🚀 How to Use

### For New Developers

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stephanecoumbassa/schoman.git
   cd schoman
   ```

2. **Run the quick install script**
   ```bash
   ./quick-install.sh
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB** (in `backend/.env`)
   - Use MongoDB Atlas (cloud) - recommended
   - Or install MongoDB locally
   - Or use Docker: `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo`

4. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start the backend** (in one terminal)
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

6. **Start the frontend** (in another terminal)
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the app** at http://localhost:5173

### For Verification

Run the verification script anytime to check your setup:
```bash
./verify-setup.sh
```
