---

## Security & Authorization Verification

### Authentication ✅
- All endpoints require valid JWT token
- Token verification via authenticate middleware
- Unauthorized requests return 401

### Authorization ✅
- **View operations**: All authenticated users (admin, teacher, student)
- **Create/Update operations**: Admin and teacher only
- **Delete operations**: Admin only
- Role checks via authorize middleware
- Unauthorized access returns 403

### Frontend Role-Based UI ✅
- Edit/Delete buttons hidden for non-admin/teacher users
- Create buttons only visible to admin/teacher
- All roles can view data (read-only for students)

---

## Data Validation Verification

### Backend Validation ✅
- Required fields enforced in Mongoose schemas
- Field types validated (String, Number, Date, ObjectId)
- Constraints: totalQuantity >= 0, availableQuantity >= 0
- Book availability check before creating loan
- Student and Book existence verification
- Enum validation for loan status

### Frontend Validation ✅
- Form field validation in Vue components
- Required field checks
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during async operations

---

## Database Schema Verification

### Collections Created ✅
1. **books** - Book inventory
   - Indexes: Text index on title, author, isbn
   - Soft delete via isActive flag
   
2. **loans** - Loan records
   - Indexes: Compound indexes on student+status, book+status
   - Status tracking: borrowed, returned, overdue

### Seed Data ✅
- 6 books across different categories
- 19 total book copies
- 1 sample active loan
- Proper relationships between book and student

---

## Integration Points Verification

### With Existing Modules ✅
- **Authentication Module**: Uses JWT tokens and role-based access
- **Students Module**: References student records in loans
- **Dashboard Module**: Library statistics can be displayed

### New Module Integration ✅
- Routes properly registered in main index files
- Models imported and used correctly
- Controllers follow existing patterns
- Views follow existing UI/UX patterns
- API service follows existing structure

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```
Expected output:
- ✅ 6 books created with 19 copies
- ✅ 1 loan created
- ✅ Sample users created (admin, teacher, student)

### 2. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Expected: Server running on http://localhost:3000

### 3. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Expected: App running on http://localhost:5173

### 4. Test Login
- Admin: `admin@schoman.com` / `admin123`
- Teacher: `teacher@schoman.com` / `teacher123`
- Student: `student@schoman.com` / `student123`

### 5. Test Library Module
- ✅ Navigate to "Gérer les livres"
- ✅ View book list with pagination
- ✅ Search and filter books
- ✅ Add new book (admin/teacher)
- ✅ Edit book (admin/teacher)
- ✅ Navigate to "Gérer les emprunts"
- ✅ View loan list with filters
- ✅ Create new loan (admin/teacher)
- ✅ Return loan (admin/teacher)
- ✅ Verify book availability updates

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Book Covers**: Not yet implemented (field exists, UI pending)
2. **Barcode Scanning**: Not yet implemented
3. **Email Notifications**: Not yet implemented
4. **Book Reservations**: Not yet implemented
5. **Overdue Updates**: Manual via API (cron job recommended)

These are documented as future enhancements and do not affect core functionality.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization ✅
- Text indexes on books for search
- Compound indexes on loans for filtering
- Selective field population in queries
- Pagination on all list endpoints (max 100 per page)

### Frontend Optimization ✅
- Lazy loading of data
- Pagination to limit data transfer
- Loading states for better UX
- Efficient component rendering
