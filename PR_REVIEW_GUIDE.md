## üß™ Manual Testing Guide

### Testing File Upload

1. **Start Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

2. **Test Avatar Upload:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/uploads/avatar \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "avatar=@/path/to/image.jpg" \
  -F "uploadType=avatars"
```

Expected: 201 Created with avatar path and thumbnail

3. **Verify Processing:**
- Check `backend/uploads/avatars/` directory
- Verify image is resized
- Verify thumbnail exists

### Testing Export

1. **Test Student Export:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/exports/students/pdf \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --output students.pdf
```

Expected: PDF file downloads

2. **Verify PDF:**
- Open PDF in viewer
- Check formatting
- Verify data is present

3. **Test Excel Export:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/exports/students/excel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \

### Uploads
- Files stored locally (not cloud storage)
- No CDN integration
- Directory must be writable

### Exports
- Large datasets may take time to generate
- No pagination for exports
- All data loaded into memory

### None of these are blockers - just future improvements
