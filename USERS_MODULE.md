# ðŸ‘¥ Users Management Module Documentation

## Overview

The Users Management Module is a comprehensive user administration system for the Schoman school management application. It allows administrators to manage all user accounts including teachers, parents, and other administrators. This module is essential for maintaining the school's staff directory and access control.

## Features Implemented

### User Management
- âœ… Create, read, update, and delete users
- âœ… Support for multiple roles (admin, teacher, parent)
- âœ… Password management and reset functionality
- âœ… Search by name or email
- âœ… Filter by role and active status
- âœ… Track contact information (phone, address)
- âœ… View user statistics
- âœ… Prevent deletion of last admin

### Role-Based Access Control
- âœ… Admin-only access to user management
- âœ… Teachers can view user list (read-only)
- âœ… Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- âœ… Role-based feature restrictions

## Backend Implementation

### Models

#### User Model (`backend/src/models/User.ts`)
```typescript
interface IUser {
  email: string;                // Required, unique, lowercase
  password: string;             // Required, hashed with bcrypt
  firstName: string;            // Required
  lastName: string;             // Required
  role: 'admin' | 'teacher' | 'student' | 'parent';
  phone?: string;               // Optional contact number
  address?: string;             // Optional physical address
  isActive: boolean;            // Account status (default: true)
  createdAt: Date;              // Auto-generated
  updatedAt: Date;              // Auto-updated
}

  }
}
```

### API Service

#### New Methods in api.ts

```typescript
// User management
async getUsers(params?: QueryParams)
async getUser(id: string)
async createUser(userData: Partial<User> & { password: string })
async updateUser(id: string, userData: Partial<User>)
async updateUserPassword(id: string, password: string)
async deleteUser(id: string)
async getUserStats()
```

### Dashboard Integration

Added "GÃ©rer les utilisateurs" card to dashboard quick actions:
- Visible only to admins
- Purple-themed icon (user group)
- Located between Students and Classes
- Direct link to `/users` route

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Teacher

1. Navigate to Users Management (admin only)
2. Click "Ajouter un utilisateur"
3. Fill in the form:
   - PrÃ©nom: Marie
   - Nom: Dupont
   - Email: marie.dupont@school.com
   - Mot de passe: secure123 (min 6 chars)
   - RÃ´le: Enseignant
   - TÃ©lÃ©phone: 0601020304 (optional)
4. Click "CrÃ©er"

### Changing a User's Password

1. Find the user in the table
2. Click "Mot de passe" button
3. Enter new password (min 6 characters)
4. Click "Changer"

### Filtering Users

- **Search**: Type name or email in search box
- **By Role**: Select from dropdown (Admin/Teacher/Parent)
- **By Status**: Select Active or Inactive
- **Combine filters**: All filters work together

### Deactivating a User

1. Find the user in the table
2. Click "Modifier"
3. Change "Statut" to "Inactif"
4. Click "Modifier"

Note: Inactive users cannot log in but their data is preserved.

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Protection**: System prevents deletion of the last admin account
2. **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
3. **Access Control**: Only admins can manage users
4. **Email Uniqueness**: System enforces unique email addresses
5. **Role Restrictions**: Teachers have read-only access to user list

## Data Validation

### Backend Validation
- Email: Required, must be valid email format, unique
- Password: Required (create), minimum 6 characters
- First Name: Required, trimmed
- Last Name: Required, trimmed
- Role: Required, must be one of: admin, teacher, parent
- Phone: Optional, trimmed
- Address: Optional, trimmed

### Frontend Validation
- Email: Required, type="email"
- Password: Required (create only), minlength="6"
- First Name: Required
- Last Name: Required
- Role: Required, dropdown selection
- All fields: HTML5 form validation

## Testing Recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Cannot create user with existing email
- **Solution**: Check if email is already in use. Emails must be unique.

**Issue**: Cannot delete admin user
- **Solution**: System prevents deletion of the last admin. Create another admin first.

**Issue**: Password not accepted
- **Solution**: Ensure password is at least 6 characters long.

**Issue**: Page not accessible
- **Solution**: Users module requires admin role. Verify you're logged in as admin.

**Issue**: Changes not reflected
- **Solution**: Refresh the page or check if the API request was successful.

## Conclusion

The Users Management Module provides a complete solution for managing school staff and parent accounts. It follows security best practices, includes comprehensive validation, and integrates seamlessly with other modules in the Schoman system.
